# CSC3095-Machine-Learning
Welcome to my repository on the Machine Learning project that I did in my third year at Newcastle University. 

## How do I use this?
The project was created in Goolge Colab and therefore you cannot download it to run as normal. Instead just click the Notebook above and then there will be a button available to take you to Google Colab in order to use it.

## Can I edit it?
You cannot edit my notebook, but feel free to use it as inspiration to create your own!

## Why should I learn Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is a great topic to cover today and in years to come. The more we know about Artifical Intelligence, the further humans can progress.
